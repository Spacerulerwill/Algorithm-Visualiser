# Algorithm-Visualiser
My Programming Project - a WIP algorithm visualisation tool designed to be used as a teaching/learning resource

I aim to include 4 types of algorithms:    
 * Sorting Algorithms
 * Maze Generation
 * Maze pathfinding
 * Terrain Generation with Noise

And for each I aim to include
  * A visual representation
  * Documentation on how, when and why they are used
  * Example implementations
  * Configurable parameters
