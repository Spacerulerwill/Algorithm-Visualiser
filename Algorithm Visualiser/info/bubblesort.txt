Bubble Sort is a comparative, in-place sorting Algorithm

Time Complexity:

Best Case - O(n) when list already sorted
Average Case - O(n^2)
Worst Case - O(n^2)

How It Works:

The list is iterated through, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order. This repeats until a pass through is made with zero swaps.

Advantages:

Simple and easy to implement and understand
Fine for small lists

Disadvantages:

Inefficient for large lists
Slowest of the O(n^2) sorts by a large amount
