Counting Sort is a non-comparative, not in-place sorting Algorithm and requires auxiliary space

Time Complexity:

All cases - O(n+k) where n is the number of elements and k is the element range

How It Works:

The array is iterated through, and  the minimum and maximum element are determined. A count array is then created with the size of the range with all values initialised to 0. This is to store the numbers of occurrences of each element.

It is then iterated through again, this time for each element incrementing the correct index in the count array.

Then finally a new array is constructed using the information stored in the count array.

Advantages:

Linear time
Works very fast when the range of elements does not exceed the amount of elements.

Disadvantages:

Inefficient when the range elements is significantly larger than the amount of elements
